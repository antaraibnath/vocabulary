Var - declares a variable, and you can also assign a value to it whilst declaring it. If you declare a variable in a function, you can only use it in that function (local) but if you declare a variable outside a function it is global.


This - commonly used inside functions and objects, and it refers to one object, usually the one in which the function operates. It returns the value of an object.

  
New - used to create an object from a constructor function.
